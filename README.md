# Shelly Goins | Applied Prompt Engineer with Real-World Impact

Welcome. I’m Shelly—a prompt engineer who doesn’t just write clever instructions for AI. I build prompts that solve problems, clarify complexity, and deliver results. My work spans legal systems, technical troubleshooting, and strategic planning—always grounded in empathy, precision, and purpose.

## 🧠 Why I’m Different

I didn’t come from Silicon Valley. I came from the real world—where broken laptops, court deadlines, and banking barriers don’t wait for perfect conditions. I’ve used prompt engineering to:

- Explain felony classifications in plain English
- Guide users through BIOS resets and device recovery
- Strategize detox plans tailored to autoimmune conditions
- Navigate financial systems when institutions say “no”

I build prompts that work under pressure, for people who need answers now.
